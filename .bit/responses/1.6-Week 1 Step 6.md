## Trying to make node-fetch happen

### ‚úÖ  Task:

- [ ]  run `git pull` 
- [ ]  make sure you are in the `week1` branch 
- [ ]  create and deploy an HTTP trigger Azure Function that creates a request for an image from the Cat API
- [ ] place your function URL in a [repository secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) called `TWOCATZ_ENDPOINT`
- [ ] commit function code in a file named `TwoCatz/index.js` to the `week1` branch

*Note: Every time you make a new commit to `week1`, we will check your function by making a request.*

**Hint:** You should try using the `node-fetch` module, but there are many other ways to do it as you can see [here](https://www.twilio.com/blog/5-ways-to-make-http-requests-in-node-js-using-async-await).

<summary>üîµ I'm still a little lost, some more help would be great!</summary>
    </br>

1. Let's use the `node-fetch` module for this task. Install it on your Azure Portal console:

**Step 1: Install the module**
In the left tab, scroll down to **Console**.

![console](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52464195/93178238-cf5c4e00-f6e8-11ea-90ab-c42f746cf04e.png)

Enter these commands in order:

```sh
npm init -y 

npm install node-fetch
```
*If you're confused about what this "package" thing is, we'll explain more in depth in the next step.*

**Step 2: Add it to your code**

Add this line of code to reference the module at the top of your code:
`const fetch = require('node-fetch)`

2. Time to make the request!

```js
let resp = await fetch(THE_ENDPOINT, {
    method: 'GET'
});

let data = await resp.arrayBuffer()
// we need to receive it as a buffer since this is an image we are receiving from the API
// Buffer?? https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob
```
**Your turn!** What should you place in place of `THE_ENDPOINT`? Change the code.
> **Tip:** You're going to have to make two of these requests, so create two *different variables* for each request to get a different picture.

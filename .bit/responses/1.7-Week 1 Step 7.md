## Name your Cat

### ✅  Task:
- [ ] Modify your Azure Function to output TWO randomly generated cat pictures from the cat API and TWO names from list below:
    * "Shreya, Emily, Fifi, Beau, Evelyn, Julia, Daniel, Fardeen"
- [ ] You should return the images and names in **JSON format** in the body
    ```js
    body: {
        cat1: your-first-catpicture-in-base64,
        cat2: your-second-catpicture-in-base64,
        names: [name1, name2]
    }
    ```
- [ ] Make sure you're in the `week1` branch
- [ ] Commit your updated function code in `TwoCatz/index.js` to the `week1` branch
### Specifications
- [ ] API endpoint: https://cataas.com/cat/cute/says/Bitcamp
- [ ] You should return the images encoded in **base64**

### 🚧 Test your Work
When you paste your **Function URL** in your browser or make a GET request with **Postman**, you might get something like:
```json
{
  "cat1": "/9j/4AAQSk...",
  "cat2": "R0lGODlhCwHI...",
   "names": [
    "Daniel",
    "Shreya"
  ]
```
> :bulb: The Base64 is shortened for clarity!
Input the base64 into [this converter](https://base64.guru/converter/decode/image) to see whether your images are correct.

### Return your images encoded in base64!
Base64 is *just another way to represent data.* We can also represent the number 11 or 0 in base64. Remember that the images you see on your screen are actually just numbers!

```js
base64data = Buffer.from(originaldata).toString('base64')
//put what you want to turn into base64 inside "original data"
//"originaldata" will be encoded in base64.
```

When we're coding websites, we can use base64 to display images on websites. The base64 outputted from your API can be used to create this:

Base64 encoding allows programs to encode binary data into text (ASCII characters) in order to prevent data loss. We do this since there are certain transfer channels that only reliably transfer text data, and this encoding method allows us to safely transfer images in the form of text.


**For fun:** Once your API successfully returns the images in *base64*, you can see what they look like using [this](https://base64.guru/converter/decode/image) website.

<summary>:exclamation: How can I select random items out of a list?</summary>
    </br>

**Hint 1:** You'll need to create an array with the names first.
**Hint 2:** You'll need to generate a random number within the range of the array length.

<details>
<summary>🔵 I'm still a little lost, some more help would be great!</summary>
    </br>

1. Create an array with the names:
```js
var names = ["name1", "name2"...]
```

2. Generate a random value in the correct range:
```js
var random_value = Math.floor(names.length * Math.random())
```

3. Get the name!
```js
var resultname = names[random_value]
```
Wrap the code for generating a random combination into a function called `nameFinder()` and return resultname.

*Call nameFinder() twice to get two names!*

<summary>:exclamation: Now that I've got everything, how do I return it?</summary>
    </br>

`context.res` is the key to answering this question!

To return your two images and two names in the output:
```js
context.res = {
    body: {
        cat1: your-first-catpicture-in-base64,
        cat2: your-second-catpicture-in-base64,
        names: [name1, name2]
    }
}
```
